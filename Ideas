Ideas:
- Test save genes params
- min/max number of species
- cluster center in exploration
- restructure genomes for distance plot
- better cluster threshold
- inter-gene crossover
- Train a bit everywhere. Top Species get extra compute time. Top Individuals of Species get more of that.
  More training -> higher penalty
- Every gene has a detail to its weight. e+v of all weights, e+v in regions (e.g. col,row,blocks), all weights
  Higher detail -> higher penalty
- Mutation chances change dynamically (What works gets boosted)
(-) dilation, bias for Kernel
(-) Mutation exception/variance
    Same for the selection of what genes to mutate
- stride dial for Pooling
(-) better structure seperate algorithm / initialization/ data

Todo:
- Viele Testläufe um gute Werte zu finden für:
   - Elitism
   - Selection
   - ...
